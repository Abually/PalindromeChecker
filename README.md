# PalindromeChecker

this is a simple C program written to check if 
a word or a phrase is a palindrome;palindromes are
phrases that read the same from both ends e.g mom.
In this program ,header files such as <ctype.h>,
<string.h> and <stdio.h> are used due to their rich 
character altering functionalities such as strlen,fgets...
Loops are also put into practice in this program.
This is a great program to master different character functionalities.
